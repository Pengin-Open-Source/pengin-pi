<h3>Mission</h3>
<article>My life's mission has been steady progress and self improvement.  Life always seems to be one step forward and two steps back.  My work keeps me continuously looking forward whilst learning from those mistakes.  The mission of this site is to showcase the personal works and postings of Stuart Anderson and promote an expat community of like minded engineers in Japan.</article>

<h3>Discord</h3>
<article>I have created a <a href="https://discord.gg/TbGuFHgqbG">Discord</a> community for like minded expats and engineers living in Japan, adults only.  If you find yourself living in Japan, are an engineer, IT guy, programmer, DBA, or nerd, feel free to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/TbGuFHgqbG">community</a>.  No solicitors.  I didn't create a free avenue of communication to pay someone to build a crappy website for me.  I am also open to teaching Python or AWS development on the discord if enough people sign up for a class.  I will use this discord to teach English to kids for free.  My volunteer work is separate from the engineering and Japan life discord.<br><br></article>

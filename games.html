<h3>Games</h3>
<article>
	In 2019, I created a game demo in pygame for my children to show them how video games are made.  <a href="https://github.com/stuart909/shootergame">Shooter Game Demo</a> is a simple platformer using artwork my daughter made in PAINT.NET.  My kids were super excited to see artwork they had made moving around in the game, but soon lost interest in the oldschool space platformer many of us grew up with when we were children, so I stopped working on the project due to lack of interest.
	<br>The game loop is functional, though you will quickly see that there isn't much point to it after you blow up a few enemies.
	<br>My daughter wants to work on another game with me, though I am told it has to be something she wants to play.  I am holding out for a compromise.

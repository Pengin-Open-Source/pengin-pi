<h3>Resigned</h3>
<article>I have resigned from my duties at Amazon Japan as a data center technician. Amazon is going in another direction with the data center role and I wish to move forward in my career.  As a server and network infrastructure technician, I've been fortunate to be included in major programming projects and have learned a great many new skills outside of the core job. Having worked shifts and a demanding schedule continuously for over 3 years with no end in sight, I feel it's best that I seek opportunities elsewhere.<br><br></article>

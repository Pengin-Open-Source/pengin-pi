<h3>A New Year</h3>
<article>We are well into the new year, budgets and goals are finalized, and everyone is going about the daily grind doing their best to break those margins.  Though seemingly in the dark for years, Tobu Pengin aims to place itself back on a road map of to success.  For starters, I have taken the liberty of finally getting around to updating the "new look", now somewhat aged, with some lines of javascript to allow for dynamic loading of content.  A lot of features had been planned for this site but have yet to be implemented.  While nothing major has been accomplished thus far, it is my hope that this small step is a positive one towards major progress.<br><br>I still have many obligations outside of the company that consume a great deal of my time, though I have found, lately, that much of the spare time I do have has been spent researching technologies and writing code.  Moving forward, it is my hope that this website becomes a tool for my efforts and an eventual resource for a new sort of clientelle.  For starters, all pages and links are now dynamically loaded into place, so load times are a tad quicker and storage requirements on my S3 bucket is lessened.  I will be able to quickly deploy articles by writing up a word document and running a script that will automatically modify a few files and upload the resources online.<br><br>I was going to spin up an EC2 instance and run a Django server, but I decided against it due to the monthly costs associated with running this.  I am small and want to limit my resource consumption, even if it means designing in-house tools to quickly leverage the cheapest services for maximum usage potential.  Hint hint my dear readers, for those looking to save a few bucks on migrating to the cloud, I may know a thing or two.<br><br></article>

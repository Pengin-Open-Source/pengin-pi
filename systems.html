<h3>Systems Engineering</h3>
<article>I have generally specialized as a systems engineer or linux administrator for most of my career.  At the peak of my systems career, I was certified in EMC SAN and had expertise in installing and maintenancing enterprise storage.  I have since moved on to developing software in the cloud, but I also work on IOT devices and other server systems with the caviat of leveraging the cloud or another specialized interface.  <br><br>Engineering is a fascination of mine, so if you have questions or would like to discuss options, feel free to contact me.
